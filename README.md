# GameServer
GameServer is a desktop, LAN web server built on the Thingy.WebServerLite engine. It is intended to provide a means of exchanging secret information between players in a game without anyone having to take on a "GM" role.

The intention is that GamerServer will support a plug-in architecture where games are added by dropping config, web resources and a dll containing controller classes into the folder containing the .exe
